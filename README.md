Task Overview
This repository contains the work completed during my internship at CODTECH IT SOLUTION PVT. LTD. The project consists of two main tasks: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Predictive Modeling using Linear Regression.

Task One: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
In this task, I performed EDA using Python libraries such as `pandas`, `numpy`, and `matplotlib`/`seaborn` to explore a dataset of my choice and gain insights into its characteristics, distributions, correlations, and outliers.

### Key Steps
1. Data Loading: Loaded the dataset using pandas.
2. Data Exploration: Explored the dataset to understand its structure, data types, and basic statistics.
3. Visualization:
   - Histograms: Visualized the distribution of variables.
   - Scatter Plots: Explored relationships between variables.
   - Heatmaps: Visualized correlations among features.
Findings
- [Include any interesting insights, correlations, or patterns discovered during the analysis.]


Task Two: Predictive Modeling with Linear Regression
In the second task, I implemented a simple linear regression model to predict a continuous target variable based on the selected dataset.

### Key Steps
1. **Data Preparation**:
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
   - Prepared the features and target variable for modeling.
  
2. **Model Training**: 
   - Trained a linear regression model on the training data.

3. **Model Evaluation**: 
   - Evaluated the modelâ€™s performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.

4. **Visualization**:
   - **Regression Line**: Visualized the regression line.
   - **Actual vs. Predicted Values**: Plotted to assess model accuracy.

### Findings
- [Summarize the results and any challenges faced during model implementation.]
